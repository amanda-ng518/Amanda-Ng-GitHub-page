## A2: An ANOVA approach for statistical comparision of human capital availability in countries with different HIV:AIDS prevalence
### Graded 90/100
Comments: "Very thorough, especially considering this is all self taught. It would be helpful to introduce the data a bit before showing the code to clean/process it, because otherwise it is hard to read the code. Additionally, some of the bulletted items could be put into paragraph form to improve the flow a bit more. Otherwise, this was very informative, thorough and an important dataset/analysis. Great job!"
